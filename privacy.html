      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <br>
      <p>PageScript knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Our website address is https://pagescript.online/</p>
    <br>
      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <br>
      <p>The information we learn from customers and subscribers helps us personalise and continually improve your learning & sales experience at pagescript.online. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
    <br>
      <p><strong>Information You Give Us: </strong>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. Go to the Subscribe Page to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.</p>
    <br>
      <p>We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future product sales offers for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>Types of Data Gathered</h3>
    <br>
      <p><strong>The information we collect falls under two categories:</strong></p>
      <p>
      <ul>
       <li>Passively Collected Information</li>
       <li>Voluntarily Provided Information</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <br>
      <p><strong>Passively Collected Information</strong></p>
    <br>
      <p>This is the information we collect as a result of you navigating our site. Like most website operators, we collect (via websites) non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our websites.</p>
    <br>
      <p>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, and do not disclose such information.</p>
    <br>
      <p><strong>Voluntarily Provided Information</strong></p>
    <br>
      <p>This is where you ‚Äúactively‚Äù share your personal information with us. Whether or not you provide this personal information is completely optional. Examples of such events include subscribing, purchasing products, opting-in with forms, completing surveys, and posting comments.</p>
    <br>
      <p>This ‚Äúoptional information‚Äù may include your name, username, e-mail address. Once you submit personal information to the company or site we may collect and store information about your activities on the site.</p>
    <br>
      <p><strong>Website Tracking Technology</strong></p>
    <br>
      <p>Our website uses tracking technology to help us to analyze user behavior.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Google Analytics is an example of this technology. It is an analysis service by Google Inc., which allows us to analyze the use of our website application usage.</p>
   <br>
   <p>The information about your visit collected by Google Analytics is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. Google will use the information collected on behalf of the application operator to evaluate the users‚Äô use of the application, to compile reports about the users‚Äô activities within this application, and to provide further services for the application operator related to the use of the application.</p>
   <br>
   <p>We will not attempt to gather any personally identifiable information about you through Google Analytics. By using this website, you explicitly consent to your information being collected by some form of website tracking technology.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Comments</h3>
   <br>
   <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor‚Äôs IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Testimonials</h3>
   <br>
   <p>If you provide us with a testimonial, you give us your consent for the use of your name and the Service to be displayed on any of our Websites, or in our other marketing materials, together with the content of the testimonial that you provide.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Should you wish for your testimonial to be removed please let us know using the contact details provided below.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Ads</h3>
   <br>
   <p>If any ads appear on any of our websites, they may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. <br><br>This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by pagescript.online and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Cookies</h3>
   <br>
   <p>Cookies are small text files of information stored by your internet browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies to collect browsing data, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information and to collect general usage and volume statistical information.

   <br>
   <p>You may set your internet web browser to refuse cookies or to remove cookies from your hard drive.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Opt-out</h3>
   <br>
   <p>If you are a newsletter subscriber, you always have the option of no longer receiving them. At the bottom of each newsletter there is an opt-out option.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Use of Information</h3>
   <br>
   <p>We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
   <br>
   <p>We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information, only when required to do so by law, or when we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the company, third parties or the public at large.</p>
